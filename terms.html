        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

        <p>Welcome to Home Revival Brisbane. By using our service coordination platform, you agree to the following
            terms and conditions:</p>

        <h2>1. Our Role</h2>
        <p>Home Revival Brisbane acts solely as a service coordinator to connect you with local professionals for your
            household service needs, such as lawn mowing, repairs, cleaning, painting, and more.</p>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> provide the actual services ourselves and are not responsible for the quality,
            timeliness, or any other aspect of the services delivered by third-party professionals.</p>

        <h2>2. Service Provider Selection</h2>
        <p>We carefully select professionals based on our experience and knowledge of local businesses to provide you
            with the most appropriate help.</p>
        <p>However, we cannot guarantee the outcome or satisfaction from any particular service provider.</p>

        <h2>3. Service Fee</h2>
        <p>There is a one-time $30 coordination fee charged to you for using our service.</p>
        <p>If we are unable to find a suitable service provider for your request, we will refund this fee in full.</p>

        <h2>4. Payment and Pricing</h2>
        <p>Pricing for services is determined solely by the service providers. Home Revival Brisbane does not set,
            control, or handle payments for the services rendered.</p>

        <h2>5. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The $30 coordination fee is non-refundable once we have successfully connected you with a service
                provider and
                coordination work has begun.</li>
            <li>If the assigned service provider fails to attend as scheduled, we will make reasonable efforts to find a
                suitable replacement as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>If no replacement provider can be found within a reasonable timeframe, we may offer a refund at our
                discretion.
            </li>
            <li>If a replacement is offered but you choose to cancel the request, no refund will be issued, as
                coordination was
                still provided in good faith.</li>
            <li>Any disputes about service quality or charges should be addressed directly with the service provider.
            </li>
        </ul>



        <h2>6. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Home Revival Brisbane is not liable for any damage, loss, injury, or other issues arising from the services
            provided by third parties.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that you engage service providers at your own risk and that Home Revival Brisbane acts only
            as a facilitator.</p>
        <h2>7. Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Your personal information submitted through our platform will be used solely for coordinating your requested
            services and will not be shared with unrelated third parties.For further information, please refer to our

            the service constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>

        <h2>9. Emergency & Urgency Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Home Revival Brisbane is <u>not</u> an emergency service and must not be used in
            place of contacting emergency services. If your situation involves an immediate threat to life, safety, or
            property — including but not limited to fire, gas leaks, electrical hazards, serious injury, or structural
            collapse — please call <strong>000</strong> or your local emergency number.</p>

            are not responsible for any harm, damage, or consequences caused by attempting to use this platform in
            emergency situations.</p>
        <p>Additionally, requests marked as <strong>urgent (ASAP)</strong> are subject to a higher coordination fee of
            <strong>$60</strong>. This charge reflects the additional effort and prioritisation required to respond
            quickly. This fee is non-refundable once we begin coordination, even if a service provider cannot be found
            immediately.
