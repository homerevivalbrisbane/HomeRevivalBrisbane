    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Home Revival Brisbane. By using our service coordination platform, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>

    <h2>1. Our Role</h2>
    <p>Home Revival Brisbane acts solely as a service coordinator to connect you with local professionals for your household service needs, such as lawn mowing, repairs, cleaning, painting, and more.</p>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> provide the actual services ourselves and are not responsible for the quality, timeliness, or any other aspect of the services delivered by third-party professionals.</p>

    <h2>2. Service Provider Selection</h2>
    <p>We carefully select professionals based on our experience and knowledge of local businesses to provide you with the most appropriate help. However, we cannot guarantee the outcome or satisfaction from any particular service provider.</p>

    <h2>3. Service Fee</h2>
    <p>A one-time coordination fee is charged to you for using our service. This fee varies depending on the type of service requested:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Electrical and Plumbing:</strong> $50 coordination fee</li>
      <li><strong>General Household Services (Handyman, Painting, Carpentry):</strong> $30 coordination fee</li>
      <li><strong>Cleaning, Gardening, Lawn Mowing:</strong> $20 coordination fee</li>
      <li><strong>Other:</strong> Initial $20 coordination fee. Additional fees may apply depending on the professionals required (max $50).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This fee is payable upon form submission and is used solely to coordinate your request. If no suitable provider is found, the fee will be refunded in full.</p>

    <h2>4. Payment and Pricing</h2>
    <p>Pricing for services is determined solely by the service providers. Home Revival Brisbane does not handle or control payments for services rendered.</p>

    <h2>5. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The coordination fee is non-refundable once a service provider is assigned and coordination work begins.</li>
      <li>If the assigned provider fails to attend, we will attempt to find a replacement promptly.</li>
      <li>If no replacement can be found, a refund may be offered at our discretion.</li>
      <li>Choosing to cancel after a replacement is offered does not entitle a refund.</li>
      <li>Disputes about service quality or charges should be addressed directly with the provider.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Home Revival Brisbane is not liable for any damage, loss, injury, or other issues arising from services provided by third parties. Users engage service providers at their own risk; we act only as facilitators.</p>

    <h2>7. Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Your personal information is used solely for coordinating requested services and will not be shared with unrelated third parties. See our <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank" style="color:#1a0dab; text-decoration:underline;">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>

    <h2>9. Emergency & Urgency Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Home Revival Brisbane is <u>not</u> an emergency service. For immediate threats to life, safety, or property, call <strong>000</strong>. Urgent requests marked ASAP incur an additional $40 coordination fee, non-refundable once coordination begins.</p>

    <h2>10. Service Area</h2>
    <p>Currently, Home Revival Brisbane operates exclusively within the Brisbane metropolitan area.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms & Conditions, please <a href="contact.html" target="_blank" style="color:#1a0dab; text-decoration:underline;">contact us</a>.</p>
